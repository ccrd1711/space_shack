            <p>Welcome to Phaedrus-1711. Welcome to Space Shack. This is the future. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Phaedrus-1711, discovered in 2023, is a newly discovered planet in the Andromeda Galaxy. 
                This planet is known for its mountainous terrain, fabulous views of its ringed brother planet Kerouac-47 (and further away sister planet Ishmaela-1992 on a bright day!), and of course the Dark Matter Lake. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Since its discovery, Space Shack has been the premier destination for intergalactic travelers seeking a unique and tranquil getaway.
