# Introduction 

## A Brief Summary 

Welcome to the Space Shack website - a simple booking and review portal for a fictional accommodation based on planet Phaedrus-1711. My daughter, 4, loves Space and recently has been going through a phase of want to learn everything about all the planets right after story time at night. One night at bed time she asked if we could "Go up there one day". So although the idea for project 3 went through many different phases, I think it began that night.

# Design Development

### Wireframes 

## Images 
All the images in this project were made using my own prompts given to ChatGPT. I generally believe we all need to harness the abilities of AI, but this project simply wouldn't have been possible in a creative way for obvious reasons without it. I had a very clear image of my landing page from day 1 (See Design) and the rest followed from there. The only tricky part of the prompts was trying to keep the "layout" of the planet uniformed through different prompts that created different angles, but I think I've succeeded in the most part.
